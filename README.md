Manual Testing Job Application Task  
Please write definitions for these test 1. Regression tests 2. Smoke tests 3. Functional tests 4. Load Tests.

1. Regression tests .
Is software testing to confirm that a recent program or code change has not adversely affected existing features.
Regression Testing is nothing but a full or partial selection of already executed test cases which are re-executed to ensure existing functionalities work fine.
This testing is done to make sure that new code changes should not have side effects on the existing functionalities. It ensures that the old code still works once the latest code changes are done.

2. Smoke tests .
is a software testing process that determines whether the deployed software build is stable or not. Smoke testing is a confirmation for QA team to proceed with further software testing. It consists of a minimal set of tests run on each build to test software functionalities. Smoke testing is also known as "Build Verification Testing" or “Confidence Testing.”
In simple terms, we are verifying whether the important features are working and there are no showstoppers in the build that is under testing.
It is a mini and rapid regression test of major functionality. It is a simple test that shows the product is ready for testing. This helps determine if the build is flawed as to make any further testing a waste of time and resources.
The smoke tests qualify the build for further formal testing. The main aim of smoke testing is to detect early major issues. Smoke tests are designed to demonstrate system stability and conformance to requirements.
A build includes all data files, libraries, reusable modules, engineered components that are required to implement one or more product functions.

3. Functional tests .
is a type of software testing that validates the software system against the functional requirements/specifications. The purpose of Functional tests is to test each function of the software application, by providing appropriate input, verifying the output against the Functional requirements.
Functional testing mainly involves black box testing and it is not concerned about the source code of the application. This testing checks User Interface, APIs, Database, Security, Client/Server communication and other functionality of the Application Under Test. The testing can be done either manually or using automation.

4. Load Tests
is a non-functional software testing process in which the performance of software application is tested under a specific expected load. It determines how the software application behaves while being accessed by multiple users simultaneously. The goal of Load Testing is to improve performance bottlenecks and to ensure stability and smooth functioning of software application before deployment.
